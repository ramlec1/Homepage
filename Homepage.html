                        Computer science has brought society several innovations that have changed our lives forever. It is to no surprise that wealth and fame comes to the people who created these innovations. This website talks about some of the most famous people in Computer Science and how they changed society with their invention.

                        The first topic is about Alan Turing. He is considered the father of the electronic computer. His work layed the foundation of Computer Science as we know it today. The computers which emerged after Alan Turing created the Enigma decrypting computer, were very big. That would change by the advent of the personal computer.
                        <br/>
                        One of the key people in bringing the pc to the public was Bill Gates. Together with Paul Allen he created the company Microsoft. They developed an operating system, that could be used by computers of different hardware manufacturers. This made it accessible to the general public and introduced the computer into the life of the ordinary citizen.  
                        <br/>
                        With a pc in the homes of a lot of people, the next big thing would be to let all computers communicate with each other and make information available everywhere. This is called the internet. However, it was not easy to find information on the internet at first. This changed when Larry Page and Sergey Brin created Google. This service indexed the internet and made it possible to easily search for the information needed. The search engine brought the internet to the general public.
                        <br/>
                        After the popularity of the internet it was Mark Zuckerberg who created Facebook connecting not just computers, but the people using them.
